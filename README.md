# redditParserGUI
simple project I made to learn more about graphical user interfaces and leaning towards a more user friendly version of the reddit parser I had created prior.

*Note only tested and run on Fedora Linux OS may or may not work on other distros

Also used the color system to create an alternate dark mode for easier reading
